Subject: Follow-Up on Data for Model Development

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

Following our recent presentation of the model, I understand that your team is interested in building a similar model for your use case. As discussed, we are waiting for the data your team planned to share to proceed with the development.

Please let me know if there’s anything you need from my side to facilitate the data sharing process. Once the data is received, we can schedule a follow-up meeting to align on the next steps and timelines.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
