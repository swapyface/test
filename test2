The discrepancy arises because the Z-score method and the explicit ±2 standard deviation method are fundamentally different in how they interpret the data, especially in the presence of skewness or extreme values. Let me explain this step by step.

Key Factors:

	1.	Z-Score and Mean/Std Sensitivity:
	•	The Z-score formula relies on the mean and standard deviation of the dataset:
￼
	•	When there are extreme values (e.g., 1000), both the mean (￼) and the standard deviation (￼) are heavily influenced by these large values, which makes the dataset look more “spread out” than it actually is. As a result, extreme values (like 1000) can end up with a Z-score within the threshold (￼).
	2.	Explicit ±2 Standard Deviations:
	•	When you calculate bounds directly using ￼, it still uses the same mean and standard deviation, but it doesn’t normalize the data. Instead, it provides a range of acceptable values:
￼
	•	If your data is skewed, the standard deviation increases, which can push the bounds further apart, allowing extreme values like 1000 to fall within the bounds.

Why is ￼ an Inlier with Z-Score?

	1.	Effect of Skewness:
	•	If your data is not normally distributed and is right-skewed (e.g., most values are small but some are very large), the mean gets pulled toward the larger values.
	•	The standard deviation increases because it measures the spread of the data.
	2.	Example Calculation:
Let’s say your dataset is:
￼
	•	Mean (￼):
￼
	•	Standard Deviation (￼):
￼
￼
	•	Z-Score for 1000:
￼
	•	Since ￼ is less than 2, it’s classified as an inlier.
	3.	Explicit ±2 Std Dev Bounds:
	•	Lower Bound:
￼
	•	Upper Bound:
￼
	•	Since 1000 falls within these bounds, it’s also an inlier by this method.

Why Does 2 Standard Deviations Around 300 Make Sense?

The explicit ±2 std deviations method you’re referring to might be based on data grouped by a specific category (e.g., rating). If you calculate mean and std dev for a subset of your data (e.g., only for “AA” ratings), the bounds might narrow because the subset has less variability.

For example:
	•	If only “AA” ratings are: ￼,
	•	Mean:
￼
	•	Standard Deviation:
￼
	•	Bounds:
￼
	•	Here, 1000 would clearly be an outlier, as it exceeds the bounds.

What Should You Do?

To resolve the issue, consider these approaches:
	1.	Use Grouped Statistics:
	•	Compute the mean and standard deviation for each rating group (e.g., “AA,” “BB”), instead of the entire dataset. This avoids extreme values from other groups affecting the results.
	2.	Visualize the Distribution:
	•	Plot histograms or boxplots for each rating group to see if the data is skewed. If the data is not normal, Z-scores might not be the best approach.
	3.	Use Robust Measures (IQR):
	•	Consider using interquartile range (IQR), which is less affected by extreme values, to detect outliers:
￼
	•	This approach works well for skewed data.
