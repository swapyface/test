Subject: Re: Sharing Technical Details of Outlier Detection Model

Hi [Their Name],

Thank you for your interest in our outlier detection approach. I’d be happy to share the technical details of our model to explore if it could be applied to your dataset.

In our setup, we’re using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which is particularly effective for identifying anomalies in high-dimensional data. Here’s an outline of our approach:
	1.	Algorithm Choice: We selected Isolation Forest as it isolates outliers by constructing random partitions, making it suitable for large datasets with potentially complex anomaly patterns.
	2.	Data Characteristics: Our model was trained on a dataset with [mention dataset size, e.g., 300K records], containing both numerical and categorical variables. Given the imbalanced nature of the data, we adjusted model parameters to improve sensitivity to rare anomalies.
	3.	Feature Engineering: We focus primarily on the [mention specific columns, e.g., ‘price’] column for outlier detection, handling each rating category separately to accommodate varying distribution patterns across groups.
	4.	Parameter Tuning: Based on the dataset’s size and characteristics, we iteratively tuned Isolation Forest parameters like contamination level and max samples to better capture outliers without overfitting.
	5.	Anomaly Definition: Outliers in our model are defined as data points significantly deviating from the bulk of the distribution, based on both domain-specific thresholds and model-derived scores.

Looking forward to our meeting, where I’ll dive deeper into these details. I’ll also be able to answer any specific questions you may have on how to adapt the model to your data structure.

Best regards,
