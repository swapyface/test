1. Introduction

Objective of the Model

The goal of this model is to detect outliers in Break-Even Spread (BES) data, ensuring accurate financial analysis and risk management. By identifying unusual data points, we can:
	•	Improve data reliability.
	•	Detect potential market anomalies.
	•	Enhance decision-making in bond pricing and valuation.

Why Outlier Detection is Important?
	•	Inconsistent break-even spreads can lead to mispricing of bonds and incorrect risk assessments.
	•	Outliers can result from market shocks, data errors, or unusual trading patterns.
	•	Detecting and handling anomalies ensures better financial forecasting and investment strategies.

2. Methodology

Approach Used

We applied two outlier detection techniques:
	1.	Z-Score Method (Previously Used)
	2.	Isolation Forest (Current Model)


Aspect
Z-Score Method
Isolation Forest (ISO)
Approach
Statistical method based on standard deviation
Machine learning model that isolates anomalies
Assumptions
Data follows a normal distribution
No prior assumptions about data distribution
Effectiveness
Works well for small datasets with normal distribution
Better for large datasets with complex structures
Handling of Non-Linear Patterns
Limited
Effective
Interpretability
Easy to understand
More complex but robust
Performance on Imbalanced Data
May miss outliers in skewed data
Handles imbalanced data well



Why ISO Model?
	•	The Z-score method assumes a normal distribution, which may not hold for break-even spread data.
	•	The ISO model works better with non-linear relationships and large datasets with imbalances.
	•	It provides higher accuracy and better detection of extreme values.

3. Results & Insights
	•	The ISO model successfully identified anomalous break-even spreads that could be market outliers.
	•	It performed better than the Z-score method in detecting subtle anomalies in complex data.
	•	The results were validated with domain knowledge to ensure accuracy.

4. Business Impact
	•	Enhanced Risk Management: Detecting unusual break-even spreads helps mitigate financial risks.
	•	Better Decision-Making: Ensures accurate bond pricing and investment strategies.
	•	Improved Data Integrity: Reduces errors in financial reporting and forecasting.

5. Conclusion

The shift from Z-score to Isolation Forest improved the accuracy and reliability of outlier detection in Break-Even Spread data. This model helps in identifying financial anomalies, reducing risks, and making informed investment decisions.
