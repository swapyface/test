Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false


class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sp = tp = 0

        while sp < len(s) and tp < len(t):
            if s[sp] == t[tp]:
                sp += 1
            tp += 1
        
        return sp == len(s)


You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000


class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        first_num = float("inf")
        second_num = float("inf")
        for n in nums:
            if n <= first_num:
                first_num = n
            elif n <= second_num:
                second_num = n
            else:
                return True
        return False

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

 

Example 1:

Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
Example 2:

Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
