Description:

Set up a scheduler to automate the execution of the ML model at predefined intervals. The scheduler should ensure seamless integration, configurable scheduling intervals, error handling with retries, and robust logging for monitoring and troubleshooting. The implementation should be lightweight, efficient, and scalable to meet performance requirements without overloading system resources. Proper documentation and testing should be completed to ensure the scheduler functions reliably in production.
