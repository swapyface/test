Here are some points explaining why Isolation Forest (ISO) might be better than Z-score for outlier detection:

1. Multidimensional Data Handling

	•	Isolation Forest can naturally handle multidimensional data and detect outliers in complex feature spaces.
	•	Z-score works well only with univariate data or requires additional preprocessing (like PCA) for high-dimensional data.

2. Assumption of Distribution

	•	Isolation Forest does not assume any specific data distribution. It is suitable for non-Gaussian or skewed data.
	•	Z-score relies on the assumption of a normal distribution; it may fail if the data distribution is non-Gaussian.

3. Robustness to Scaling

	•	Isolation Forest is less sensitive to feature scaling or units of measurement.
	•	Z-score requires data to be standardized for accurate results, as it depends on the mean and standard deviation.

4. Performance on Imbalanced Data

	•	Isolation Forest performs well with imbalanced datasets because it isolates anomalies rather than relying on density or frequency.
	•	Z-score may not effectively identify outliers if the data is imbalanced or contains clusters with varying densities.

5. Detecting Non-linear Patterns

	•	Isolation Forest can detect non-linear relationships and complex outliers in the data.
	•	Z-score only identifies outliers based on linear deviation from the mean.

6. Ability to Handle Categorical Variables

	•	While Z-score is primarily limited to numerical variables, Isolation Forest can be adapted to include encoded categorical features.

7. Scalability

	•	Isolation Forest scales well with large datasets due to its tree-based structure and efficient algorithm.
	•	Z-score involves computationally expensive calculations (mean and standard deviation) for very large datasets.

8. Sensitivity to Extreme Outliers

	•	Isolation Forest is better at isolating extreme and subtle outliers by design.
	•	Z-score can flag too many data points as outliers if the data contains extreme values that inflate the standard deviation.

9. Suitability for Anomalies in Time-Series

	•	Isolation Forest can handle anomalies in sequential or time-series data by considering temporal dependencies (if features are engineered accordingly).
	•	Z-score typically requires additional logic to work effectively for time-series anomalies.

10. Ease of Hyperparameter Tuning

	•	Isolation Forest provides hyperparameters (e.g., contamination ratio, number of trees) that can be tuned for specific datasets.
	•	Z-score lacks flexibility and requires manual threshold setting (e.g., ±3 standard deviations) to detect anomalies.

In summary, Isolation Forest is a more advanced and versatile method, especially for multidimensional, non-Gaussian, imbalanced, or large-scale datasets, while Z-score is simpler but limited to straightforward univariate, normally distributed cases.
