Here’s a sample of an acceptance criteria for your Jira ticket regarding setting up the scheduler for your ML model:

Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	Scheduler Functionality:
	•	The scheduler must trigger the ML model execution at the predefined intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, etc.).
	•	The scheduler must handle retries in case of model execution failure.
	2.	Configuration Management:
	•	Scheduling intervals must be configurable via a properties file or environment variables.
	•	The scheduler should allow enabling/disabling the job without code changes.
	3.	Logging and Monitoring:
	•	Detailed logs must be generated for each scheduler run, including job start time, end time, and status (success/failure).
	•	Failures should trigger alerts/notifications for relevant stakeholders.
	4.	Error Handling:
	•	The system must log errors with detailed stack traces for troubleshooting.
	•	If a failure occurs, the scheduler should retry execution based on a defined retry policy (e.g., 3 attempts with a 5-minute delay).
	5.	Performance:
	•	The scheduler must not affect the overall system performance or overload resources.
	•	The execution of the scheduler should complete within acceptable runtime limits.
	6.	Integration Testing:
	•	Verify the scheduler triggers the ML model correctly in a staging environment.
	•	Ensure the scheduler runs only during the configured intervals and does not duplicate executions.
	7.	Documentation:
	•	Provide documentation detailing how to configure, test, and maintain the scheduler.

Feel free to customize based on your specific requirements.
