Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.


Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
