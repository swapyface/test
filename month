# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'df'
grouped_data = {rating: group for rating, group in df.groupby('rating')}

# Now you have a dictionary where the keys are the ratings, 
# and the values are the DataFrames for each rating.

# For example, to access the DataFrame for a specific rating, e.g., 'A':
df_A = grouped_data['A']

# Display the DataFrame for 'A'
print(df_A)
