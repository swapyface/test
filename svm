Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Here's a list of some common data structures:
Linear Data Structures:
 * Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
 * Linked Lists: A sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
 * Stacks: A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure, where elements are added and removed from the top.
 * Queues: A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
Non-Linear Data Structures:
 * Trees: A hierarchical structure of nodes connected by edges, with a root node and child nodes.
   * Binary Trees: Each node has at most two children.
   * Binary Search Trees: Ordered binary trees for efficient searching.
   * Heaps: Trees that satisfy a heap property (e.g., min-heap or max-heap).
 * Graphs: A collection of vertices (nodes) and edges connecting them.
 * Hash Tables: Data structures that use a hash function to map keys to values for efficient lookup.
Other Data Structures:
 * Sets: Collections of unique elements.
 * Maps (Dictionaries): Key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers many of the most commonly used data structures. Each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem.
